# _IN C_ In C

This repository contains all the relevant source code to compile a program that can produce midifiles of 

# Original Readme
This is the continuation of libsmf, a BSD-licensed C library for reading
and writing Standard MIDI Files (*.mid). It transparently handles
conversions between time and pulses, tempo maps, and more. Full API
documentation and an example program (which is also rather useful in
its own right) are also provided. libsmf was originally written and
maintained by Edward Tomasz Napiera≈Ça at http://libsmf.sourceforge.net/.

You will need a C compilation environment and the GLib development files
to compile this. It builds in the usual autotools manner:

  $ ./autogen.sh  # if it's a fresh git clone
  $ ./configure [configure options]
  $ make
  # make install
